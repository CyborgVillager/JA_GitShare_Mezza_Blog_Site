# Django Site with the aid of Mezzanine

Basically help aid in the creation of a CMS style site, while saving time & improving
efficiency of a content - sharing project.

Will update this site to further improve my understanding of python, web creation, and eventually A.I development.
So far this journey has been great and I cant wait to see what my skills will become in the next few months - years from now!
