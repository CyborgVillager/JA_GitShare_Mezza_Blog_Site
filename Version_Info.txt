               | --------------------------- |
               | v# : Short Version Title    |
               | Description: v# description |
               | --------------------------- |

v0 : Introduction of the project and the main intent of it
v1: Setup Mezzanine, created login/setup basic db, will work further on the admin side
v2: Added 'About Us Page' & a custom post to test out a couple of features of using Mezzanine
v3: Updated mezzanine_pyvenv / placed in corrected format
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
--v4: Collected the templates from Mezzanine to be used as temp drafts for future testing/improvements for the site.
command to do this (while in my_project dir) -> python manage.py collecttemplates -> rename to tempdrafts

    * In order to 'move' a file such as form.html you have to copy the whole folder. e.g to aquire form.html copy
pages(tempdrafts) into your templates folder (theme/templates). This is due to referencing the data tree.

    * As of now I've just copied base.html from tempdrafts and paste into onto templates. Since base.html didn't have
    a main folder for reference you'll be okay.

    * Ensure on my_project/settings.py line #202 or known as  os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "templates"), has 'templates'
    to allow proper data to be transfered to the site. Thanks in part to stackoverflow for assistance ->
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41519534/static-files-not-found-in-mezzanine

    * line 65 - 67 on editing the search feature @ templates/base.html ->
    <div class="navbar-collapse collapse">
    {% search_form "blog.BlogPost" %} or 'pages.Page' to either only search for blog posts, pages, etc. As of now
    its default to search for all to give the user the option to choose the info that they desired

----------------------------   ----------------------------   ---------------------------- ----------------------------
v5 <-o_o->:  When working on aquiring info from theme/static ensure you follow this format ->
                {% static 'folder/folder/info/info' %}
               Aquired the template from : https://startbootstrap.com/themes/clean-blog/ and impletemented some of its
                features onto the site for a 'clean look'

v6 <-o_o->: Worked further on improving the site design from v5, updated the nav bar to auto aquire the info, included
                tempdrafts/pages/menus into templates for better menu design.

v7 <-o_o->: Removed a breadcrumb menu, removed empty boxes to the right of the screen, that holds no data.
                Cleaned the code of any info that is not being used. Will include if any new functions are needed for
                the site. As of now the essentials are being built.
                * on templates\index.html to aquire image follow this format :
                  <header class="masthead" style="background-image: url('{{STATIC_URL}}img/home-bg.jpg')">

v8 |o_o|:    Fixed Navigation / Design issue -> updated  {% page_menu "pages/menus/dropdown.html" %} to
                primary.html @ <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarResponsive"> line # 71-72

                Activated Blog feature of Mezzanine /my_project/urls.py -> url("^$", blog_views.blog_post_list,
                name="home"), while commenting out url("^$", mezzanine.pages.views.page, {"slug": "/"}, name="home"),
                see urls.py for more information in regards to a BLOG-ONLY SITE vs HOMEPAGE AS STATIC TEMPLATE
                or check the documentation @ http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/configuration.html

                uncomment -> from mezzanine.blog import views as blog_views @ urls.py , include BLOG_SLUG = '' @
                settings.py under CUSTOM SETTINGS

                to make a 'home page' import this into urls.py -> from mezzanine.pages.views import page
                comment  from mezzanine.blog import views as blog_views and un-comment
                url("^$", page, {"slug": "/"}, name="home"),

                Its orignally was mezzanine.pages.views.page. If you keep it as it is, an error will occur. So only
                delete mezzanine.pages.views. so it will be page,

                To aquire more info check mezzanine @ mezzanine_pyvenv/mezzanine/pages/views.py

----------------------------   ----------------------------   ---------------------------- ----------------------------
v9:           For now Ill just use url("^$", direct_to_template, {"template": "index.html"}, name="home"),
                    and comment out the rest. including from mezzanine.pages.views import page
                    Will check on the other options after finish with this test project
v10: Disabled Blog_Slug in settings. So now the web page will show tabs such as /about only /about/ instead of
        /pages/about

--v10.5:     -Edit: Updated base.html - included a link to the github from the github icon, if a user clicks on it
                It will take them to the github respo
